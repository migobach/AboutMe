                <h3>Travels</h3>
                <h5>Traveling internationally, and in my backyard.</h5>
                <p>Traveling is a love of Michael's. It has taught him things of great value. As a high school student, Michael fell in love with traveling when he studied abroad on the Canary Islands in Spain, where he learned Spanish, and different way of life. In recent years, travel has been dictated by a running and camping bucket list. This bucket list is both goal oriented, and a method to pursue challenges that prove that Michael is still alive!</p>

                <h5>Fiber arts, stone carving, and pottery.</h5>
                <p>A creative outlet makes for a sane individual when the mind is constantly working. Michael has long held a passion for making everyday items beautiful and functional. From handknit sweaters, mitts and hats, to hand pieced quilts. Making practical pieces of art has proven to be the perfect creative outlet. Lately, Michael has been diving into making pieces out of stone under the guidance of a master stone carver. Carving stone lamps offers Michael and opportunity to blend the old with the new, while mastering a new craft.</p>

                <h5>The most important activity in daily life.</h5>
                <p>Adventuring and getting out into the wilderness is Michael's happy place. Running on single track trails through forests, mountains, along beaches, and coastal cliffs are what bring Michael the greatest happiness. Running races from 50 to 100 miles is what keeps the motivation high and the experience fresh. Furthermore, lengthening the distance allows Michael to test his limits and dicover how to push his threshold.</p>

        <p>A partner is crime is a something we all need. Michael and Natura will be married for 10 years in 2019. Each day is an adventure. Both share a passion for running, quilting, gardening, and exploring the outdoors. Natura works as a Groundfish and Shellfish Manager for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Natura's work brings her on adventures across the Gulf of Alaska, out the Aleutian Chain, and into the Bering Sea. She is an all around badass.</p>

        <h3>Godiva</h3>
        <h5>The best dog in a whole fricken world</h5>
        <p>Godiva comes from a lineage of Alaskan huskies that hail from Teller, Alaska. However, Godvia joined Michael and Natura in Fairbanks, Alaska, where she was working on a <a href="https://justshortofmagic.com/">sport race team</a>. Godiva dislikes food, and was therefore adopted into Michael and Natura's family as the original musher needed dogs who would eat, as feeding at -50&deg can be a chore when dogs aren't eating. Godiva now enjoys running, and sleeping in her box. She still dislikes eating.</p>

        <h3>George</h3>
        <h5>Becoming a pet is hard work</h5>
        <p>George came to live with Michael and Natura in Novemeber, 2017. George was born on the Kenai Penninsula to <a href="http://teamzappa.com/">Team Zappa</a>. Sadly, George was never strong enough to run the Itarod with Team Zappa as he gets too excited once in his harness, and is hot out of the gate every time! Long races like the Itarod require pacing, and deliberate running. George is better at running like a mad man until he can run no more. George is learning how to live in a family home and out of the dog yard; he loves snuggling by the fireplace, going for runs, and eating treats.</p>
