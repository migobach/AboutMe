    <h3>Background</h3>
    <h5>What is the connection here?</h5>
    <br>
    <p>As an exchange student in Spain during Michael's senior year of high school, he became enamored with languages. Being able to communicate with other people from different cultures, backgrounds, and points of view was motivational. Accessing new ways of interpreting the world around him through a new language opened up doorways perviously unimaged.</p>

    <p>Upon returning to the United States, Michael was recruited as a Crypotlogic Linguist for the United States Air Force where he leared Persian-Farsi, opening pathways to another unique culture, worldview, and perspective. It became clear to Michael that working with languages was a pathway worth pursuing.</p>

    <p>After a four year enlistment, Michael completed his four year degree in Languages and International Studies at the College of St. Scholastica. During his studies, he was able to spend time studying in Petrozavodsk, Russia, and completed an internship with a non-profit organization in Quito, Ecuador. Further exposure to diverse peoples and work environments was motivating and offered room to grow personally.</p>

    <p>Upon graduation, Michael moved to Alaska and soon after moving to the state, began a Master's in Arctic and Northern Studies focusing on Alaska Native language revitalization efforts on Kodiak Island, off the south western coast of the state. Authoring a thesis on language policy and planning drew Michael into a new paradigm while granting him the unique opportunity to learn an endangered language spoken by fewer than 30 people, most of whom were elderly. Working with, and learning from another culture, and different age group was a unique privledge offered to few.</p>

    <p>Over the last seven years, Michael has worked with non-profits, tribal entities, and museums in Kodiak in a variety of grant funded positions exposing him to diverse work environments and job duties. Exposure to diverse work environments has taught Michael how to adapt, and identify the type of work place in which he thrives. Similarly, his professional experience has taught the value of work-life balance.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, non-profit work is valubale work, particularly when serving in rural communities, however, professional and personal growth are central to Michael's goals; finding opportunity for continued growth in the non-profit community has proven difficult. Therefore, making the opportunity to further pursue a creer in development is both enticing, and logical next step.</p>
